# Single-Rod Brachiation

An organization for managing source code for the joint research project on single-rod brachiation between the Czech Technical University, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Dept. of Instrumentation and Control Engineering and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Systems Engineering.

Currently the organization contains code for simulating the single-rod robot in julia as well as the Arduino control loop program (C++) who's first versions were written by Hijiri Akahane but was later heavily modified and extended by Juraj Lieskovsk√Ω.
As a side note there also exists a short [script for parsing Arduino serial output](https://gist.github.com/lieskjur/6f5b448fc157e70ad28dbcabc78c7a46) managed as a gist.
I would suggest we manage all relevant code that would/does benefit from source control here, adding additional organization owners as we see fit.
